# A dynamical network representation of cell-cell communication strategies

This folder provides a set of codes to build and run a ShinyApp in R which allows for visualization of gene set enrichment (GSE) plots. 

The codes have been built to visualize GSE of ligand-receptor interactions among myeloid cells but can be easely updated to build the visualization for your own dataset. 

To this end, update the **generate_data_for_app.R** by setting your data directory (```R data_dir``` variable)
